# Thesis
With the rising popularity of sport climbing and bouldering, there are increasing incentives to take it to the online space.
This thesis does so in way suitable for regular climbing gyms.
A workflow for creating 3D hold and wall models and the accompanying editor has been developed, so that routes can be copied from the real world to the virtual one and be interacted with in a more immersive way.

- [Clis](https://github.com/Climber-Tools/Clis) – efficient 3D scanning of climbing holds and climbing gym interiors.
- [Cled](https://github.com/Climber-Tools/Cled) – a 3D editor designed for efficient virtual routesetting.
