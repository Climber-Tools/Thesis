# A slightly improved bachelor thesis template

- modern packages
- modern fonts
- less confusing directory structure
- slightly more useful examples (figures, diagrams, tables, code listings)
- Czech version has correctly named references
- builds abstracts

See the [pre-built version](build/thesis.pdf) for details

## How-to

1. Type `make`, check that everything compiles. You should get a `thesis.pdf` that passes PDF-A validation. If not, complain.
2. Fill in `metadata.tex` and all `xmpdata` files.
3. Look at the example code (there are several hints), remember it, erase it.
4. Write the thesis.
5. Submit and defend the thesis.

PDF-A validation can be checked using the validator: https://github.com/mff-cuni-cz/cuni-thesis-validator
