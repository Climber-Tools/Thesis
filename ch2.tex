%After the reader gained sufficient knowledge to understand your problem in \cref{chap:refs}, you can jump to your own advanced material and conclusions.
%
%You will need definitions (see \cref{defn:x} below in \cref{sec:demo}), theorems (\cref{thm:y}), general mathematics, algorithms (\cref{alg:w}), and tables (\cref{tab:z})\todo{See documentation of package \texttt{booktabs} for hints on typesetting tables. As a main rule, \emph{never} draw a vertical line.}. \Cref{fig:f,fig:g} show how to make a nice figure. See \cref{fig:schema} for an example of TikZ-based diagram. Cross-referencing helps a lot to keep the necessary parts of the narrative close --- use references to the previous chapter with theory wherever it seems that the reader could have forgotten the required context.

%\begin{thm}[Car coloring]\label{thm:y}
%All cars have the same color. More specifically, for any set of cars $C$, we have
%$$(\forall c_1, c_2 \in C)\:\Col(c_1) = \Col(c_2).$$
%\end{thm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%Use induction on sets of cars $C$. The statement holds trivially for $|C|\leq1$. For larger $C$, select 2 overlapping subsets of $C$ smaller than $|C|$ (thus same-colored). Overlapping cars need to have the same color as the cars outside the overlap, thus also the whole $C$ is same-colored.\todo{This is plain wrong though.}

%\section{Extra typesetting hints}
%
%Do not overuse text formatting for highlighting various important parts of your sentences. If an idea cannot be communicated without formatting, the sentence probably needs rewriting anyway. Imagine the thesis being read aloud as a podcast --- the storytellers are generally unable to speak in boldface font.
%
%Most importantly, do \underline{not} overuse bold text, which is designed to literally \textbf{shine from the page} to be the first thing that catches the eye of the reader. More precisely, use bold text only for `navigation' elements that need to be seen and located first, such as headings, list item leads, and figure numbers.
%
%Use underline only in dire necessity, such as in the previous paragraph where it was inevitable to ensure that the reader remembers to never typeset boldface text manually again.
%
%Use \emph{emphasis} to highlight the first occurrences of important terms that the reader should notice. The feeling the emphasis produces is, roughly, ``Oh my --- what a nicely slanted word! Surely I expect it be important for the rest of the thesis!''
%
%Finally, never draw a vertical line, not even in a table or around figures, ever. Vertical lines outside of the figures are ugly.

\chapter{Realization}

The realization of the project can be separated into three distinct parts: \textbf{creating wall model}, \textbf{creating hold models}, \textbf{editor implementation}. Each of the respective parts are open-source projects on GitHub, licensed under GPLv3:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \raisebox{-0.07em}{\includesvg[height=\baselineskip]{images/clis.svg}} -- the climber's scanner \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Climber-Apps/Clis}}
	\item \raisebox{-0.07em}{\includesvg[height=\baselineskip]{images/cled.svg}} -- the climber's editor \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Climber-Apps/Cled}}
\end{itemize}

\section{Creating wall model}
The wall model \ref{fig:model} has been created semi-automatically.
First, a set of 188 images was used by the Agisoft Metashape software to create a reference model.
This model was then manually edited in Blender 3D to remove possible modelling errors.
Since the wall consists only of straight segments connected together, this can be done relatively easily.
After manual changes, the resulting model was reimported to Metashape to generate the texture from the photos.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/wall/image.png}
	\caption{The model of the Sm√≠choff boulder wall, created using Metashape and Blender.}
	\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}


\section{Creating hold models}
Since a regular climbing wall contains hundreds or even thousands of holds of varying sizes, it would be infeasible to model each of them manually.
It is important to automize as many steps as possible so that the amount of manual work done is minimized.

This has been acomplished using a turntable-based workflow, upon which the holds are placed and scanned.
The turntable turns the hold around for a stationary camera to take photos, which are then fed into the Agisoft Metashape protogrammetry software (+ Blender for post-processing) to generate the model.

The resulting workflow can process a single hold in $\sim 40$ seconds of scanning (taking $12$ photos, varies depending on lighting conditions), plus  $\sim4$ minutes of processing.

\subsection{Turntable design}
A three stepper-motor turntable has been developed and 3D printed using the Fusion 360 CAD software and an Ender Pro 5 3D printer \label{ref:turntable}.
An Arduino board and A4988 motor controllers are used for fine motor control \ref{fig:wiring}.
The communication with the Arduino is implemented via USB using the serial port.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includesvg[width=\columnwidth]{images/wiring.svg}
	\caption{The wiring diagram of the turntable, created using Fritzing.}
	\label{fig:wiring}
\end{figure}

To minimize the amount of friction, the only points of contact between the top and bottom part are 7 bearings (6 placed in a circular pattern and 1 directly in the middle).
Additionally, gears mounted to the motors turn the top of the turntable, achieving a TODO reduction.
This allows the turntable to handle objects of weight up to TODO (heavier objects have to be turned manually).

	\subfloat[\centering Top part.]{{\includegraphics[height=3.6cm]{images/turntable/top.png} }}%

	\caption{Parts of the model of the turntable, created using Fusion360.}%
	\label{fig:turntable}
\end{figure}

The top area is connected to a plexiglass with a marked center and 4 markers.

\subsection{Environment setup}
Two LED lights, mounted on adjustable stands and covered with baking paper (for diffusion) were used to achieve good lighting conditions.
Aditionally, since the camera is static, 300 ISO and 22 f/s were used to maximize the image quality.

	\caption{An image of the setup during scanning, including the taken image.}
