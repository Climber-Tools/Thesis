\chapter{Cled quickstart}\label{apx:cled}

\section{Setting up}
First, download the lastest version from the \href{https://github.com/Climber-Tools/Cled/releases}{Releases page}.

To use Cled, you need a wall and holds dataset.
A dataset example, along with the specification, can be found in \verb|Models/Example|.
This dataset can then be imported to Cled either by \verb|File > New|, or by pressing
\verb|Ctrl+N|.

To generate your own dataset, use Clis \cite{clis} to generate the hold and wall models and then use \verb|Scripts/ClisImporter.py| to prepare them for usage.
Note that you will likely need to install a number of Python packages~--~to do this, you can follow the Clis setup on the \verb|Scripts/requirement.txt| file (see appendix \ref{apx:clissetup}).
