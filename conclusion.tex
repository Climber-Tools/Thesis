Clis and Cled have been implemented and tested on the Smíchoff bouldering wall.


TODO: repeat what I achieved

TODO: practical applcations

Future developments mainly include implementing a web interface so the exported routes can be interacted with by regular users.
Such interface should support the ideas outlined in the introduction, such as route filtering, liking/disliking routes and send videos.

Additional features that were beyond the scope of this project but should also be implemented in the future include automatically selecting holds from a photo of the wall, „snapping to hole“ for holds that can only be placed in specific ways, and a large number of quality-of-life improvements and bugfixes.
