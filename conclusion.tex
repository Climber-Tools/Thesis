Future developments mainly include implementing a web interface so the exported routes can be interacted with by regular users.
Such interface should support the ideas outlined in the introduction, such as route filtering, liking/disliking routes and send videos.

Additional features that were beyond the scope of this project should also be implemented, such as automatically selecting holds from a real photo of the wall, „snapping to hole“ for holds that can only be placed in specific ways, and a number of quality-of-life impmrovements.
