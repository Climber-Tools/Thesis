Clis and Cled have been implemented and successfully tested on the Smíchoff bouldering wall.
Future developments include implementing a web interface and a mobile application, so the exported routes can be interacted with by regular users.
Such interface should support the ideas outlined in the introduction, such as route filtering, liking/disliking routes and send videos.

Additional features that were beyond the scope of this project but will be implemented in the future are automatic hold selection from a photo of the wall, „snapping to hole“ for holds that can only be placed in specific ways and a large number of quality-of-life improvements and bugfixes.

The end goal is to provide Clis and Cled as a service for climbing gyms all over the world (starting with Prague), so climbers have an easier time picking where to go climbing and can better find people to go climbing with.
